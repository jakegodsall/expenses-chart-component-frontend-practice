### What I learned

This is my second solution to the [Expenses chart component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/expenses-chart-component-e7yJBUdjwt).

I decided to do it again as I have been learning D3 and it seemed a great opportunity to practice what I had learned.

I have learned a ton about D3, and SVGs in general. Some things I have learned are:

- How to make responsive SVGs.
- How to structure an SVG using the `g` element.
- How to add animations to visualisations with the `.transition()` method.
- How to import data with D3.
